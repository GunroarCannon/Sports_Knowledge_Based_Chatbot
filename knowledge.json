In 1974, Franz Beckenbauer won World Cup and Ballon d'Or but no Champions League (though Bayern won European Cup that year, but it wasn't called Champions League then). In 1998, Zidane won World Cup and Ballon d'Or but no Champions League. In 2002, Ronaldo Nazário won World Cup and Ballon d'Or, but his club Inter didn't win Champions League. The closest modern example is Lionel Messi in 2009: he won Champions League, Ballon d'Or, but World Cup came later. Kaka won Champions League (2007) and Ballon d'Or (2007) but no World Cup.

In 2022, he scored a hat-trick in World Cup final but PSG didn't reach Champions League final. In 1998, Zidane scored in World Cup final but Juventus lost Champions League final. So none? Actually, in 1974, Gerd Müller scored in World Cup final and Bayern won European Cup final (though he didn't score in that final?). He scored in European Cup final replay? Let's not overcomplicate.",

  "who is the only player to win the world cup, premier league, and champions league with same club": "Several players have won World Cup and Champions League with same club. For example, Manchester United players from 1999 (like Beckham, Scholes, Neville) won Champions League and later World Cup? Beckham won World Cup? No, he didn't. Actually, English players won World Cup only in 1966. So maybe not. But players like Xavi, Iniesta won World Cup with Spain and Champions League with Barcelona. So they did it.",

  "who is the only player to win the world cup, euro, and champions league": "Players like Cristiano Ronaldo have won Champions League and Euro (2016) but not World Cup. French players like Kylian Mbappé have won World Cup but not Euro. German players have won World Cup and Euro?

  "who is the only player to win world cup and premier league in same season": "English players only in 1966, but Premier League didn't exist then. Since 1992, no English player has won World Cup and Premier League in same year because England hasn't won World Cup since 1966. However, non-English players have done it: For example, Emmanuel Petit won World Cup with France in 1998 and Premier League with Arsenal in 1997-98 season? Actually, 1997-98 Premier League ended in May 1998, World Cup was July 1998. So same calendar year but not same season. But if we consider the 1997-98 season and the 1998 World Cup as the same season (ending with World Cup), then Petit did it. Same for Kylian Mbappé? He won World Cup 2018 but Ligue 1 with PSG that year? PSG won 2017-18 Ligue 1, so yes, same season.",

  "who is the only player to win world cup and la liga in same season": "Barcelona players who won La Liga and World Cup in same year: In 2010, Spain players like Xavi, Iniesta, Puyol won La Liga (2009-10) and World Cup (2010).",

  "who is the only player to win world cup and serie a in same season": "In 2006, Italian players like Cannavaro, Buffon, etc. won Serie A? Juventus had their title revoked in 2006 due to Calciopoli.

  "who is the only player to win world cup and bundesliga in same season": "In 1974, Bayern players like Beckenbauer, Müller won Bundesliga (1973-74) and World Cup (1974).",

  "who is the only player to win world cup and ligue 1 in same season": "French players in 1998: Didier Deschamps (Juventus, not Ligue 1), Zidane (Juventus), etc. But some French players played in France: Laurent Blanc (Marseille) won Ligue 1 with Marseille in 1991-92? Not same year. In 2018, Kylian Mbappé won Ligue 1 with PSG and World Cup. So yes.",

  "who is the only player to win world cup and champions league final man of the match in same year": "Not sure. Zidane won World Cup final MOTM (1998) and in 2002 he won Champions League final with a famous volley but MOTM might not have been official. In 2022, Emiliano Martínez won World Cup final MOTM, but Aston Villa didn't win Champions League.",

  "who is the only player to win world cup and ballon dor in the same year": "Many: Pelé (1958?), Maradona (1986?), but Ballon d'Or was only open to Europeans before 1995. So before 1995, non-Europeans couldn't win. After 1995, Ronaldo Nazario (2002) won both? He won World Cup 2002 and Ballon d'Or 2002. Also, Messi (2022) won Ballon d'Or 2023? Actually, 2022 Ballon d'Or was given in October 2022 (based on 2021-22 season) and Messi didn't win it (Benzema won). 2023 Ballon d'Or was given in October 2023 for the 2022-23 season, which included the World Cup, and Messi won.
